			<p>
				My passion for analysis and problem solving has been the main
				driving-force for me seeking out a new career that gives me more
				freedom; both in and out of work hours to improve these skills;
				Northcoders and software development was exactly the place for that.
				Working as part of a team is something I am very naturally suited
				towards as a charismatic and outgoing individual. Getting to work with
				new people to develop and present group work is something that I
				thoroughly enjoy getting to do as I get exposed to new ways of working
				and tackling problems.
