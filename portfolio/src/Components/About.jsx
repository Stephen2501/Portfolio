				<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="profile">
				<p>
					Having been based in Manchester for 4 years after graduating
					university, I decided to pursue a career that will constantly
					challenge me both in and out of work hours and help me to keep improving my
					skills; this, along with my passion for analysis and problem solving
					has been the main driving-force for me seeking out a new career in
					software development. The Northcoders bootcamp was exactly the right
					place for that; since I began the course I have been pushing myself
					more and more to excel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Working as part of a team is something I am very naturally suited
					towards as a charismatic and outgoing individual. Getting to work with
					new people to develop and present group work is something that I
					thoroughly enjoy getting to do as I get exposed to new ways of working
					and tackling problems.{" "}
				</p>
				<p>
					In my spare time I like to keep myself active by bouldering. It
					provides, what I find to be, a perfect balance between physical and
					mental activity. A bouldering problem can't always be overcome with
					just brute force and repetition; instead, taking a step back and
					re-evaluting the problem and trying a new method can be far more
					beneficial and lead to a quicker positive result. This mentality is
					one that I carry into every situation I come across.
